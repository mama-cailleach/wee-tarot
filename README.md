## About the Game

Wee Tarot transforms the ancient art of tarot reading into an interactive digital experience. Players use the Playdate's unique crank mechanism to shuffle a mystical deck, draw cards, and receive personalized fortune readings from your enigmatic tarot reader guide.

### Key Features

- **Crank-Controlled Shuffling**: Use the Playdate's signature crank to physically shuffle the deck
- **78-Card Tarot Deck**: Complete deck with Major Arcana and all four suits (Cups, Wands, Swords, Pentacles)
- **Dynamic Card Readings**: Each card offers multiple fortune variations with upright/reversed meanings
- **Atmospheric Experience**: Lofi background music, ambient rain, and carefully crafted sound design
- **Multiple Reading Modes**: Choose between full deck or Major Arcana only readings
- **Inverted Cards**: Cards can appear upside-down for reversed meanings, adding depth to readings
- **Character-Driven Narration**: Dinah provides mystical, often humorous interpretations

## Game Design

Wee Tarot balances respect for tarot tradition with playful, accessible game design:

- **Authentic yet Approachable**: Traditional tarot structure with modern, witty interpretations
- **Physical Interaction**: The crank creates a tactile connection to the mystical act of shuffling
- **Atmospheric Immersion**: Visual and audio design evoke a cozy, mystical reading space
- **Replayability**: Multiple fortune variations ensure fresh readings each time

## Technical Implementation

### Architecture & Code Design

- **Scene Management System**: Custom scene manager with fade transitions and comprehensive memory management (inspired by SquidGod's scene management patterns)
- **Animation Framework**: Integration of [AnimatedSprite library](https://github.com/Whitebrim/AnimatedSprite) with custom modifications for frame control
- **Sound Synchronization**: Real-time crank sound feedback and layered atmospheric audio
- **Memory Optimization**: Critical for Playdate hardware constraints with defensive cleanup patterns
- **State Machine Design**: Clean state transitions for shuffle → reveal → fortune sequence

### Platform-Specific Features

- **Playdate SDK**: Built with Lua using official Playdate CoreLibs
- **1-bit Graphics**: All visuals designed for Playdate's unique black-and-white dithered display
- **Hardware Crank Integration**: Custom input handling for smooth shuffle mechanics
- **Button Controls**: A/B buttons for navigation and interaction
- **Audio System**: Optimized .pda audio files for Playdate's audio capabilities

### Key Technical Challenges Solved

1. **Memory Management**: Implemented comprehensive sprite/timer cleanup for hardware limitations
2. **Animation Timing**: Complex animation chains with precise timing coordination
3. **Crank Responsiveness**: Achieved smooth crank-to-animation synchronization with audio feedback
4. **Data Organization**: Structured 78-card dataset with multiple fortune variations per card
5. **Scene Transitions**: Smooth fade effects without memory leaks or visual artifacts

## Development Tools

The card data and animations were created with custom Python tools, showcasing full-stack game development skills:

**[ Wee Tarot Tools Repository](https://github.com/mama-cailleach/python-portfolio/tree/main/python-experiments/wee-tarot-tools)**

### Animation Tools (`shuffleAnimation/`)
- **Visual Prototyping**: Python scripts for testing shuffle effects and card animations
- **Asset Generation**: Automated spritesheet creation from individual card images
- **Animation Preview**: GIF generation for iteration and preview
- **Effect Creation**: Circular shuffling, hand shuffling, scaling, fan spreads, and explosive finales

### Data Tools (`generate_card_data/`)
- **Content Pipeline**: Automated conversion from CSV/Excel to Lua tables
- **Card Database**: Streamlined process for adding new card descriptions and correspondences
- **Format Conversion**: Bridge between design documents and game-ready code
- **Scalability**: Easily adaptable for other card sets or tarot variations

## Testing & Debug Tools

The `testing/` folder contains dedicated Lua scripts for development, debugging, and QA. These tools help ensure all cards, fortunes, and UI elements display correctly and provide a robust test bed for new features.

- **mainDebug.lua**: Launches custom debug scenes to rapidly test card readings, fortune variations, and UI presentation outside normal game flow.
- **gameSceneDebug.lua**: Allows developers to cycle through every card in every suit (including Major Arcana), displaying each card visually and confirming correct rendering. Prevents random inversion for controlled testing.
- **postSceneDebug.lua**: Steps through the fortune text for each card, in both upright and reversed orientations. Displays all possible fortune variations and keyword sets in sequence, mirroring live game narration.
- **mainTest.lua**: A minimal demo showcasing Playdate's animation system, useful for prototyping and verifying animator/easing functions with simple graphics.

These scripts are designed to be run in the Playdate Simulator during development. They accelerate QA by exposing edge cases (missing fortunes, rendering bugs, etc.) and support asset verification before final hardware builds.


## Creative Implementation

### Card Content Design
- **Original Interpretations**: 78 unique cards with multiple fortune variations each
- **Tone Balance**: Mystical authenticity with contemporary humor and relatability
- **Multiple Variations**: Each card offers several different fortune readings for replayability
- **Upright/Reversed**: Traditional tarot structure with distinct meanings for card orientation

### Visual Design
- **Playdate Aesthetic**: All graphics optimized for 1-bit display with careful dithering
- **Pixel Art Cards**: Custom tarot card designs by Sarah Seekins
- **Animation Sequences**: Hand-crafted shuffle animations and spritesheets with 60+ frames
- **UI/UX Flow**: Intuitive scene transitions maintaining mystical atmosphere
- **Typography**: Custom Tarotheque font family enhancing the mystical theme
- **Mixed Media Assets**: Combination of pixel art, photography adaptations, and custom art

### Audio Design
- **Layered Soundscape**: Background music, ambient rain, and interactive sound effects
- **Crank Feedback**: Real-time audio response to physical crank interaction
- **Atmospheric Immersion**: Carefully balanced audio levels for contemplative experience
- **Audio Integration**: In-game mixing, cutting, and tweaking of original compositions
